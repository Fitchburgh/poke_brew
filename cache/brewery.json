Well, to make a long story short, my forefathers in Ireland had their hand in the brewing business and crafting beer casks when barrels were made out of wood.\r\n\r\nToday, my own family is in the business of making yeast that happens to also go into the making of beer. So, it was a natural for us to revive the brewery that has been in Lexington since 1794. Welcome and enjoy.",

      "description":"Beer is an art and Drive Beer knows it well. Starting from this assumption, in 1999 The Tarricone Family takes over a factory, built in the '80es upon instruction of HM the Prince of Windisgraetz of the Austrian Family of Furstenberg who then bought the Prinz Brau Group. Later, in the '90es, this latter was acquired together with the Birra Moretti Group, by the Labatt Group.\r\nIn the next years, the Moretti-Prinz Brau Group was acquired by Interbrau and eventually by Heineken.\r\nThe entire know-how and the workers themselves have been kept by Drive Beer, thus assuring a continuity in the excellence of the brands produced. \r\nThe art of manufacturing fermented products and yeasts management is in the DNA of the Tarricone Family. Precisely, in the first years of 1900, the ancestor Giuseppe Tarricone owned several vineyards and produced an excellent wine. He was producing and selling his wine all across the inland of Lucania transporting it on his picturesque chariots drawn by horses. \r\nHe then moved the company office to Atella (PZ), and then to Bella (PZ), and eventually, bewitched by the beautiful landscape and the extraordinary nature of the surroundings of Muro Lucano (PZ), he settled down, together with his entire family of Corato origins, he married a Muro Lucano girl, whose name was Concetta Bianchini.\r\nTherefore, when in 1999 the Tarricone Family was suggested by Gerardo, one of the sons of the ancestor Giuseppe Tarricone, to take over the Brewery, belonging to the Heineken Group, it was almost physiological to the five brothers, Giuseppe, Vito, Carlo, Federico e Fabrizio, who at that time were expanding their businesses linked somehow to the food and beverages sectors, to accept this \"challenge\", which represented for the Tarricone Family a \"return to the origins\".\r\nThe Drive Beer, an industry of the national market, has managed to impose itself as a beer pole, entirely Italian, competing with the most famous multinational companies.\r\nFinally, the Company, based on the remarkable approvals made by operators, has then invested time and resources by recurring to the skills of expert advisors for realising an distributing the products.",

      "description":"Viven was originally founded in 1999 by Willy De Lobel and was called Chapel of Viven, the blonde, and Monastery of Viven, the brown. The recipe was developed by Willy De Lobel. In the absence of a brewing plant, Willy wandered through the Flemish hinterland in search of professionals that could brew his recipe.\r\n\r\nHis journey ended when he found the brewery of Dirk Naudts, called \u201cDe Proefbrouwerij\u201d. There Dirk and his staff continued to perfect the brewing process of Viven. \r\n\r\nIn 2003, Willy De Lobel decided it was time to pass on his demanding hobby, to a young and ambitious entrepreneur. In the little village of Sijsele, Willy found an enthusiastic successor in the person of Tony Traen, the son of the local liquor dealer Cyril Traen, who decided the beer was an enrichment for his company and has since taken on the job of carrying on the tradition.\r\n\r\nSince then, Chapel of Viven has undergone several changes: a brand new look, an improved recipe for the Monastery of Viven and a new name. Chapel and Monastry of Viven were baptized Viven Blond and Viven Brown.\r\n\r\nIn 2009 the time was ripe for an expansion of the range Viven. The idea to apply our Flemish brewing art to non-Flemish beers haunted Tony and together with Dirk he developed the recipes of the promising Viven Ale, Viven Porter and Viven Imperial IPA. These exceptional beers, that would truly tempt any beer connoisseur, have been successfully launched onto the beer market in 2010, making them accessible to a wider audience of beer lovers.",

During his college days the head brewer, Derek Luke, reaquired a homebrewing kit he had given his sister and quickly went to work brewing and passing his knowledge along to the company's president, Brent Ryan. As Graduation grew near and the cold reality of post-collegiate life set in Luke and Ryan knew that they could turn their affinity for beer and their new found ability to make it into a viable alternative to unemployment or sitting at a desk answering to \"The Man\". Of course, they couldn't do it by themselves, so after very little convincing, they got roommate and friends, Mark Sinclair and Will Rafferty to join them.\r\n\r\nOn Father's Day in 1999, after almost two years of planning and preperation, the first batch of Hurricane Amber Ale was brewed. By July 2nd the first kegs had been shipped to three Newport Restaurants and were quickly tapped and emptied. A little over a month after the release of the first kegs, 6-packs of Hurricane Amber Ale began to hit the shelves. Since then we have expanded our product line and our distribution territory but continue to brew up a storm in our Middletown Brewery.",

      "description":"The Elevator Brewer and Draught Haus finds its home in the historic Columbia building, built in 1897 by the Bott family to house the Bott Brother\u2019s Billiards and a gentleman\u2019s saloon. The beautiful hand-carved, hand-split Philippine mahogany bar was created to serve the whiskey distilled on the second floor. The saloon enjoyed a brisk business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920. The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling. The luxurious back-bar won the coveted blue ribbon for craftsmanship at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Many myths and legends surround this historic building, including the presence of ghosts and spirits. Perhaps during your visit with us, you\u2019ll encounter the unexpected.",

After a long and tumultuous journey involving disaster and triumph;  joy and heartache ~  they began to build. Following fourteen months of design, building and construction they finally fired up the brew kettle for the first time in December of 1999. Although the brewery was tiny and tucked in a basement on Pearl Street, the celebration and Grand Opening was enough to attract throngs of flavor starved people and get Mayor Medinger to tap the inaugural keg.\r\n\r\nWe have come a long way since. Today we brew, bottle and keg our beers from our new home in the historic La Crosse Footwear building with our expanded 30 barrel brewery. The new brewery has over six times the brewing capacity of the old Pearl Street Brewhouse. And while we spent the first 8 years slinging brews out to nearby pubs and restaurants in draught kegs only, in July of 2007, we unveiled bottled beer in six packs and cases.",

After homebrewing on the family farm for years, homebrewer Cory Schroeder teamed up with Jim Wiesender to found the brewery in 1999.\r\n\r\nUsing equipment scrounged from various industries, such as a converted pudding tank for the brew kettle, the pair launched a successful business, brewing the beer just steps away from the chicken coop and a busy dairy farm.\r\n\r\nTheir Sand Creek Golden Ale and English Style Special Ale, available only on draft and in half-gallon growlers, soon developed a reputation throughout Wisconsin's many brew fests. With a capacity of only about 150 barrels per year, the brewery, now with a third owner on board, quickly outgrew the little farm shed converted into a brewhouse.\r\n\r\nHoping to remain in the Dunn\/St. Croix counties area, the company looked for a suitable place to relocate, but came up empty handed. Then opportunity knocked in the form of a phone call one evening from their friend in Black River Falls, Pioneer brewing's brewmaster Todd Krueger. The brewery was for sale.\r\n\r\nIn March of 2004 the combined forces of the two breweries officially formed the new Sand Creek Brewing Co. of Black River Falls, Wisconsin.",

He found the perfect spot in Charlottesville, VA \u2013 an historic storefront on Main Street that was once home to the state of Virginia\u2019s first craft brewing operation. In September 1999, Starr Hill Brewery was founded. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its space with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall. Since then Starr Hill's delicious craft beers have become a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world.\r\n\r\nIn response to the growing demand, Starr Hill moved from this small operation to a larger facility several miles outside of town in 2005. The brewery and tap room are still based in Crozet, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's year-round, seasonal and limited-release brews are now enjoyed in bars, restaurants and music venues in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores throughout the region. Among the most award-winning breweries on the East Coast, Starr Hill has won 21 Great American Beer Festival, World Beer Cup and Great British Beer Festival medals.\r\n\r\nLed by Brewmaster Robbie O'Cain, Starr Hill's team is striving to make creative and world-class beer every day.

Tim's background in brewing started in his college days at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. In early 1993, his roommate at the time introduced him to the art of making beer. This smalltime hobby of making beer in a tiny apartment blossomed into a fulltime career, brewing commercially. Towards the end of 1993, Tim attended UC Davis in Northern California to study Fermentation Science. Upon returning to Salt Lake, he aligned himself with a startup brewery called Uinta Brewing Company. The concept for this startup was to brew the freshest beer available in the State of Utah while limiting the alcohol percentage to 3.2 by weight (4% by volume). It was wildly successful, providing locally made beer for the ski areas and the many tourists that visited Utah.",
